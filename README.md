# Math-Quiz
A math quiz program that
* Prompts the user for a level, . If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program prompts again.
* Randomly generates ten (10) math problems of addition according to the level set by the user
* Prompts the user to solve each of those problem. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program outputs `EEE` and prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program outputs the correct answer.
* The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score, a number out of 10.
